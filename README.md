🌱 AI Environmental Impact Analyzer

🌍 Project Overview

The AI Environmental Impact Analyzer is a decentralized Web3-powered platform that assesses the environmental footprint of consumer goods. By leveraging artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, this tool ensures transparency, trust, and community-driven sustainability. Users can analyze product descriptions, manufacturing processes, and supply chain data to generate an impact score, helping them make eco-conscious choices.

✨ Key Features

🔎 AI-Powered Product Analysis: Extracts and interprets product descriptions for environmental insights.

🏭 Manufacturing Impact Assessment: Evaluates carbon footprint and sustainability of production methods.

🚛 Supply Chain Tracking: Analyzes logistics data to measure emissions and energy consumption.

📊 Environmental Footprint Score: Converts collected data into an easy-to-understand rating.

💡 Eco-Friendly Alternatives: Suggests greener product options.

🔗 Blockchain-Powered Transparency: Ensures data integrity via decentralized storage.

🛡️ Secure Web3 Authentication: Enables login via crypto wallets (e.g., MetaMask).
